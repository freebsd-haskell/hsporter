hsporter :: PackageDescription -> FreeBSDPort

INSTALLATION:
  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock --executable (for documentation)
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install


USAGE:
  Synopsis:
    hsporter cabal_description_url port_category

    where
      cabal_description_url = valid URL of a Cabal package (probably on
        HackageDB)
      port_category = a valid FreeBSD ports category

  Example:
    Issue the following command.

      hsporter http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/DeepArrow/0.3.3/DeepArrow.cabal devel

    It will create all the files needed for a port inside the directory
    "devel/hs-DeepArrow".


DISCLAIMER:
    Please, do not forget to test and use the ports before doing
    anything with it in public.  Note that it is very experimental and
    under development.  Slippery when wet.
